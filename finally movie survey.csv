I watched it, and it seriously stuck with me.

Its about Noah and Allie, two people from totally different backgrounds who fall deeply in love one summer. But of course, life gets in the wayfamily, war, expectationsand they get separated. Years later, their paths cross again, and all those old feelings come flooding back.

What I love about it is how raw and real their love feels. Its messy, passionate, heartbreaking, and beautiful. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have insane chemistry, like you actually believe theyre in love. And theres this older couple storyline that runs parallel to the main one, and by the end? Youll be in tears. Actual, ugly crying.
